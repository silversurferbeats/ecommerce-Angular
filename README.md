# Ecommerce Angular
a WebStore project in Angular.js in progress. It is an ecommerce sheet that consumes a **API Fake Store API** in real time, to show the products sold.


## API de Cotações

Exemplos:
* https://fakestoreapi.com/products
* https://fakestoreapi.com/products?limit=5
* https://fakestoreapi.com/products/category/jewelery


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
